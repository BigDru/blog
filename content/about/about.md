Hello!

My name is Dru. I am a Senior Software Developer that pursues way too many projects and gets distracted all the time. This blog is to help me keep track of problems I've solved and how I solved them. Why? Because I will inevitably get distracted again and forget what I did.

If it ends up bringing some value to others as well, it's a win-win!
